# Shiny communication manifest

The goal of this chapter is to bring together all the concepts covered in the previous chapters and build a takeaway synthesis that can be used as a reliable basis to build strong communication architecture within Shiny apps.

## Two communication streams

There are two communication streams in a modular Shiny app:

-   the input / output stream, dedicated to server \<\> ui communication,

-   the function parameter / return value stream, dedicated to server \<\> server communication.

It is critical to remember that both streams are targeting different activities and they most likely should never cross each other.

## Module encapsulation

-   server / ui should stick to the same level (same context) and cascade top & bottom (no cross dependency)

-   where the code is located in the folder structure does not matter! could be horizontal or recursive folders
